# ANNIE Energy Scale 

This work aims to constrain the energy scale uncertainty in the ANNIE experiment.
We use scripts to select through going muons and Michel electrons from ANNIE MC 
and data samples. 

The selection of both thru-muons and Michels is directly taken from previous work
done by S. Doran.
